initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Dut","The DUT stores all objects associated with a particular device. Each object type is organized into vectors, where a particular object's position within the vector is considered its unique ID. A register then (for example) does not embed its bit objects but rather contains a list of bit IDs. This approach allows bits to be easily passed around by ID to enable the creation of bit collections that are small (a subset of a register's bits) or very large (all bits in a memory map)."]]});
