    "body": "V93K How to Install img { margin: 20px 0; } This document describes how to obtain the Origen V93K library\nand then install it within a test program. The guide is split into two parts: Part 1 - Describes how to obtain and add the library to your test program. Everyone must\ndo this part; for example when you have no plans to use it directly in your own code,\nbut you want to use another 3rd party library which depends on Origen. Part 2 - Describes the additional steps that are required if you want to use the Origen\nAPIs within your own code. Part 1 Get the Code The library is installed by placing a complete copy of the source code within your test program’s\ntop-level directory (the standard place to put test method libraries). See the FAQ for why this\napproach has been chosen. If you have access to the web and have Git installed, the easiest\nway is to check it out directly from Github: cd your/test/program\ngit clone https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen_std_lib.git Then run these commands anytime you want to change version, substituting the version reference as\nappropriate (note that this will blow away any local edits that you may have made to the library): cd your/test/program/origen_std_lib\ngit pull\ngit reset --hard v0.9.0 Alternatively, you can always download a specific version of the library from our releases page . Create a preload Symlink A symlink then needs to be created to add the Origen library to the preload folder within the\ndevice directory, this ensures\nthat it is loaded before any 3rd party libraries that depend on it: mkdir -p your/device/testmethod/sh_lib\\-EL5\\-64bit/preload\npushd your/device/testmethod/sh_lib\\-EL5\\-64bit/preload \nln -s ../liborigen.so liborigen.so\npopd Add the Library to your Workspace With the source code in place, the last step is to make sure that it can be referenced through your\ntest program’s workspace. If it has not been automatically detected, then right-click within the Project Explorer pane\nand select “Import…“ : Then select “93000” -> “Test Method Project” on the next screen: Accept the defaults on the next screen, making sure that the “origen” checkbox is enabled: The Origen test methods will now be available from the test method selector once you build\nthe program, and any references to Origen from other libraries should now be valid. If you do experience any issues at this point, please comment below to get help. Part 2 If you want to use the Origen library within your own test method library for the first time,\nthen these additional steps are required. From the “Project Explorer” pane, right-click your library and select “Properties” . Then select the options shown below to add Origen to your project’s include path: It should end up like this, with a new entry for Origen that is relative to the top-level\nworkspace: To check if everything is hooked up correctly, you can add this to one of your source files\nand see if it builds: require \" origen.hpp \" Comments /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES * * */\n var disqus_shortname = 'origen-sdk';\n var disqus_title;\n var disqus_url = 'http://' + window.location.hostname + window.location.pathname;\n\n disqus_title = $(\"h1\").text();\n if (disqus_title.length == 0) {\n disqus_title = $(\"h2\").text();\n }\n if (disqus_title.length == 0) {\n disqus_title = $(\"h3\").text();\n }\n if (disqus_title.length == 0) {\n disqus_title = $(\"title\").text();\n } else {\n disqus_title = disqus_title + ' (' + $(\"title\").text() + ')';\n }\n\n /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */\n (function() {\n var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;\n dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';\n (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);\n })(); Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus."
